## What is Docker?

- Docker is a pioneer of the containerization platform
- From a 1000 foot perspective it's like a VM but without the OS kernel overhead in your virtual machines.

---

> A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. ([Source](https://www.docker.com/what-container))
